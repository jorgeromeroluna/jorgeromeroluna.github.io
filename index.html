        <p style="font-family:courier;"><strong>My full name is Jorge Romero Luna, I was born in Mexico city <br>
        in a hospital named La Perla on April, 19, 1996. That makes me <br>
        22 years old. When I was 9 years old, I left to the United <br>
        States and lived in Vista, California. After 4 years, I moved <br>
        to Oceanside, California. I enjoyed riding bikes, riding my <br>
        skateboard, and playing soccer. I also enjoyed playing the bass <br>
        at church. A month afer I turned 21 I got deported so I've been <br>
        living here in Mexico for a year now. I enjoy to play soccer, <br>
        I enjoy to run, and now I started to enjoy to code. I'm glad <br>
        I entered Hola Code.</strong>

         <h2 style="color:white;">Education</h2>
         <p class= "secondp"style="font-family:courier;"><strong>When I was a kid, I went to an elementary school in Mexico <br>
        until third grade named Ni√±os Heroes. Then When I moved to <br>
        California, I went to Crestview elementary school for fourth <br>
        and fifth grade. In middle school I went to a middle school named <br>
        Vista Magnet Middle School. In High School, I went to one named <br>
        Rancho Buena Vista for one semester, then I moved cities so I went <br>
        to El Camino High School. Then I moved to Pacific View Charter School <br>
        and graduated there. After I graduated I went to a community college <br>
        for a couple weeks, but then I found a job so I stopped going to <br>
        school. But gladly I am now learning to code so soon I will be a software engineer.
